This is the GitHub page for my Digging mod! You can see all of the blocks used in the Blocks folder, and the most recent version of the mod itself can be found in the ProjectFolder as the "Code.dll" file (keep in mind these are the very latest versions, so it might be broken) :P

Also, none of the .zips here work because they follow the old folder structure. So you should just subscribe to it on the workshop if you want it xD
