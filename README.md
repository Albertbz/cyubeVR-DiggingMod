This is the GitHub page for my Excavater Block mod! You can see all of the blocks used in the Blocks folder, and the most recent version of the mod itself can be found in the ProjectFolder as the "Code.dll" file :D

Keep in mind I also use this repo for storing things related to the mod, for example the stuff in the "Other" folder :P
